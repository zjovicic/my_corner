          <p>Hi there! I'm Zlatko. Nice to meet you!</p>
          <p>Here I'll try to document my learning journey. Perhaps you'll find some of the projects I show here interesting.</p>
          <p>My coding journey <em>officially</em> started on <strong>October 1st 2021.</strong></p>
          <p><em>Unofficially</em> I've been dabbling with this stuff in the past, at times quite seriously. <br> Most of the skills I learned got so rusty over time to the point of needing to re-learn them almost from scratch. <br>
            For this reason, among the active skills that I'll list below, there will only be those in which I have some fresh working knowledge, and not the stuff I studied in the past, but stopped using. <br>
          </p>
          <p>
              Currently I'm following <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/"><strong><em>The Complete 2021 Web Development Bootcamp</em></strong></a>  by Angela Yu at Udemy.

    <h3>Stuff in the deep layers of my unconscious mind:</h3>
    <p>The title that first came to my mind for this section was "The Stuff That I Forgot". But then I said: No! Forgetting is not acceptable. <br>
    Nothing is ever truly forgotten. It's just residing in the deep recesses of my unconscious mind and waiting to be refreshed.</p>
